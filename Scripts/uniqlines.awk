!seen_count[$0]++
# this is a relational expression using the default action (print line)
# seen_count counts how many times a line has been seen
# seen_count starts out as 0, so !0 indicates print this line
# seen_count is incremented each time a line is seen
# so only the first time a line is printed only the first time it is seen
