Calculate urban population mean/median temp observed on date 2020-01-01

did not find best_station.txt, run pre-processing
Pre-process climate/city data independent of date

num stations  S = 958
num dates  D = 47
max station/date rows  S * D = 45026
num climate.csv rows  41513
num cities  C = 247

extract city lat/lng  O(C)
extract station lat/lng   O(S*D)

find closest station for each city, regardless of date  O(S*C)

extract climate data available on date  O(S*D)
extract station lat/lng and temp available on date  O(S)

incrementally find best station (per-city) available on date
start with pre-processed closest station regardless of date
find stations not available on given date  O(S*log(S))
find cities with closest stations not available on given date  O(C)
num cities with unavailable closest  U = 18,  (U < C)
recalculate closest station available on date for these cities  O(S*U)

for each city, get temp from closest station  O(S+C)
calculate mean and median temp over entire urban population  O(C*log(C))
